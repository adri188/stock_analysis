## Background

In order to help Steve do a little more research for his parents prior code will be refactored to loop through data once so it can handle large amounts of data to analyze stock market behavior for a few years. Data and Efficiency of the code will be analyed and results presented below. 


## Results 

### Stock Performance 

#### 2017

From 2017 to 2018 this Stocks had quite a turn around, with the exception of  RUN that showed growth and was one of the 2 yielding and maintaining positive returns. 
DQ trippled in volume however had quite a negative turnaround from ~200% return in 2017 to -62.6% . This Stock trend  is gathering strength to the downside and it is wise for Steve to spread his parents investments, and he will be able to utilize refactored code to look for more years and more stocks to make a sounder decision. 

### Code Performance

#### 2017

As seen on the images below Refactoring the original code made it real fast , only took 0.08 to run which is significantly more efficient. Original code was taking aroun 0.28 secs. When analyzing bigger data sets this will make a big difference.

## Summary
ReFactoring the code gives you the opportunity to go over ways to always improve the way you programm, also allows for avoiding wasting time trying to start everything from scratch when a similar solution is already developed and available. However when doing so one must make sure the code is well tagged and structured, and that you are able to follow the logic and have a clear debugging/testing strategy that allows for the process to really be value added rather than consuming more time and effort. 
Regarding the Challenge Example it was helpful having the initial code to get ahead on the logic . I tried to breakdown the requests and tested as I was making changes in order to properly debug. I was getting and overflow error, which I was able to figure out going through the logic and comparing with original code.
